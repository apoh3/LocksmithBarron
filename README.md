# LocksmithBarron
IN PROGRESS: Puzzle game where player molds keys to match a lock. Keys are represented as columns of blocks. When a player pounds a the top block of a column, that column loses a block...but the two surrounding columns then gain a block (as the debris falls on them). Puzzles are randomly generated. Designed in Unity game engine (only C# scripts are displayed here).
